# prework-study-guide
Boot Camp Study guide for students
# <Prework Study Guide->

## My motivation behind this project was to have background knowledge and understand the material I will be studying and using in the future. I build this project wholeheartedly to really grasp the material that is given. The requirements do not change the fact that this is what I will be learning and applying to real world issues when I offically have a job as a web developer. I learned how to navigate the terminal on my MAC and the mistakes that I made, I understood why it happen and needed to be changed. I did extensive research and reached out to a tutor when I couldn't figure out the next steps. Problem solving is important as a developer and it is important to know how to navigate through real-world issues.I had taken a course online before i signed up for the bootcamp and it helped me have an idea of the expectations from professors and my peers.
